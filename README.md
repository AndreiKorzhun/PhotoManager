# PhotoMeneger
Photo Manager is a Django program that authorized users interact with. Users can view and add photos with some metadata (geography, description), as well as mention usernames on the photo.
If desired, the user can filter the viewed photos by geolocation, date of creation and the name of the mentioned users.
